Perfect! Let's get your container running on AWS ECS as quickly as possible. We'll skip the ALB for now and just get a working deployment with a public IP.

## Step 1: Verify AWS CLI Setup (2 minutes)

First, let's make sure your AWS CLI still works:

```bash
# Check if AWS CLI is installed
aws --version

# Check if credentials are configured
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

**Expected output for the second command:**
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDAI...",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/your-username"
}
```

**If that doesn't work:**
- You might need to run `aws configure` again
- You'll need your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
- Default region: I recommend `us-east-1` (best free tier coverage)

---

## Step 2: Create ECR Repository (3 minutes)

This is where your Docker image will live in AWS:

```bash
# Create the repository
aws ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name mytower-server \
    --region us-east-2

# Expected output will include the repository URI
# Save this URI - you'll need it!
```

The URI will look like: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mytower-server`

---

Good questions! Let me address each:

## Default Output Format

I recommend **`json`** because:
- Most readable for humans
- Easy to parse with tools like `jq` if needed
- All AWS CLI examples use it by default

Other options are `yaml`, `text`, or `table`, but json is the standard.

## Region Choice: us-east-2

You picked `us-east-2` (Ohio) instead of `us-east-1` (Virginia). That's **totally fine**, but be aware:
- `us-east-1` has slightly better free tier coverage for some services
- Some AWS services launch in us-east-1 first
- **For your use case (ECS + ECR), us-east-2 is perfectly good**

Just make sure to use `us-east-2` consistently in all commands (I'll update them for you).

## Secret Key Storage - IMPORTANT! ⚠️

**YES, SAVE IT SOMEWHERE SECURE!** This is critical:

### Where to Save It:

1. **Password Manager** (Best option)
   - 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, etc.
   - Store both Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
   - Label it clearly: "AWS IAM User - mytower-dev"

2. **Encrypted Notes App**
   - Apple Notes (if using iCloud with 2FA)
   - Secure note in your password manager

3. **Physical Paper** (Backup)
   - Write it down and store securely
   - Good as a backup to digital storage

### ⚠️ NEVER:
- ❌ Store in plain text files
- ❌ Commit to Git (even private repos)
- ❌ Email to yourself
- ❌ Store in cloud notes without encryption

### Why This Matters:

**AWS WILL NOT SHOW YOU THE SECRET KEY AGAIN!**

If you lose it:
- You'll need to create a new Access Key
- Your old key will need to be deactivated
- It's a pain (but not a disaster)

### What If You Didn't Save It?

If you've already closed the window and didn't save it, you'll need to:
```bash
# Delete the half-configured credentials
rm ~/.aws/credentials

# Create a new access key in AWS Console:
# 1. Go to IAM → Users → Your User → Security Credentials
# 2. Create New Access Key
# 3. Save BOTH the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
# 4. Run `aws configure` again with the new keys
```

---

## Updated Commands for us-east-2 Step 3

Since you picked Ohio, here are the corrected commands:

```bash
# Set your region variable
REGION=us-east-2
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
ECR_URI="${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com"

# Create ECR repository
aws ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name mytower-server \
    --region ${REGION}

# Authenticate Docker
aws ecr get-login-password --region ${REGION} | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${ECR_URI}

# Tag and push
docker tag mytower-server:latest ${ECR_URI}/mytower-server:latest
docker push ${ECR_URI}/mytower-server:latest
```

**Did you save the secret key?** Once you confirm, let's verify your AWS CLI works with:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
---

## Quick Check-In Point

Once the push completes, tell me and I'll give you the next commands for creating the ECS cluster and task definition.

**Questions:**
1. Did the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command work?
2. Do you want me to give you all the commands at once, or step-by-step with verification?

I'm assuming step-by-step is better since you haven't used AWS in a few months, but I can provide a "run this script" version if you prefer!

Awesome! Your container is now in AWS. Let's get it running.

## Step 4: Create ECS Cluster (1 minute)

```bash
# Create a Fargate cluster (serverless container orchestration)
aws ecs create-cluster \
    --cluster-name mytower-cluster \
    --region us-east-2
```

You should see JSON output confirming the cluster was created.

---

## Step 5: Create Security Group (2 minutes)

We need to allow incoming traffic on port 8000 for GraphQL:

```bash
# Get your default VPC ID
VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --filters "Name=isDefault,Values=true" \
    --query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" \
    --output text)

echo "Your VPC ID: ${VPC_ID}"

# Create security group
SG_ID=$(aws ec2 create-security-group \
    --group-name mytower-sg \
    --description "Security group for MyTower ECS tasks" \
    --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --query 'GroupId' \
    --output text)

echo "Security Group ID: ${SG_ID}"

# Allow inbound traffic on port 8000 from anywhere
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id ${SG_ID} \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 8000 \
    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \
    --region us-east-2

# Allow all outbound traffic (default, but let's be explicit)
echo "Security group created: ${SG_ID}"
```

**Save that `SG_ID`** - you'll need it in the next step!

---

## Step 6: Get Subnet IDs (1 minute)

ECS needs to know which subnets to use:

```bash
# Get your default subnets
aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=${VPC_ID}" \
    --query "Subnets[*].SubnetId" \
    --output text
```

This will output something like:
```
subnet-abc123  subnet-def456  subnet-ghi789
```

**Pick the first one** (or any one) - save it for the next command.

---

## Step 7: Register Task Definition (3 minutes)

This is the "recipe" for how to run your container. Create a file called `task-definition.json`:

```bash
# Get your account ID and ECR URI
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
ECR_URI="${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mytower-server:latest"

# Create task definition file  (You have to actually use cat or manually substitute the variables from above)
cat > task-definition.json <<EOF
{
  "family": "mytower-task",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
  "cpu": "256",
  "memory": "512",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "mytower-server",
      "image": "${ECR_URI}",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 8000,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "MYTOWER_MODE",
          "value": "headless"
        },
        {
          "name": "MYTOWER_PORT",
          "value": "8000"
        },
        {
          "name": "MYTOWER_LOG_LEVEL",
          "value": "INFO"
        }
      ],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "/ecs/mytower-server",
          "awslogs-region": "us-east-2",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs",
          "awslogs-create-group": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"
}
EOF

# Register the task definition
aws ecs register-task-definition \
    --cli-input-json file://task-definition.json \
    --region us-east-2
```

**If you get an error about `ecsTaskExecutionRole` not existing**, run this first:
```bash
# 1. Create the role
aws iam create-role \
    --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \
    --assume-role-policy-document '{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {"Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"},
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }]
    }'

# 2. Attach the AWS-managed policy (gives permissions to pull from ECR and write logs)
aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

# 3. Wait a few seconds for IAM to propagate
sleep 5

# 4. Now try registering the task definition again
aws ecs register-task-definition \
    --cli-input-json file://task-definition.json \
    --region us-east-2
```
---

## Quick Status Check

Let me know when you've completed steps 4-7, and I'll give you the final command to actually **run the task** and get your public IP!

**Are you getting the outputs I described?** Any errors?

**It's all saved in AWS - don't worry about capturing it!**

The JSON output you saw is just AWS confirming what it created. You can retrieve it anytime with:

```bash
# View your task definition
aws ecs describe-task-definition \
    --task-definition mytower-task \
    --region us-east-2
```

And yes, **it's in the console too:**
- ECS → Task Definitions → mytower-task

---

## Step 8: Run Your Container! (Final Step)

Now for the exciting part - let's actually run it:

```bash
# Get your subnet ID (pick any one from the output)
SUBNET_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=${VPC_ID}" \
    --query "Subnets[0].SubnetId" \
    --output text)

echo "Using Subnet: ${SUBNET_ID}"
echo "Using Security Group: ${SG_ID}"

# Run the task
aws ecs run-task \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --task-definition mytower-task \
    --launch-type FARGATE \
    --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[${SUBNET_ID}],securityGroups=[${SG_ID}],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}" \
    --region us-east-2
```

**If you get an error about `VPC_ID` or `SG_ID` not being set**, re-run these first:

```bash
VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --filters "Name=isDefault,Values=true" \
    --query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" \
    --output text)

SG_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --filters "Name=group-name,Values=mytower-sg" \
    --query "SecurityGroups[0].GroupId" \
    --output text)
```

---

## What Happens Next

After running the task:
1. AWS provisions a Fargate instance (~30 seconds)
2. Your container starts (~10 seconds)
3. GraphQL server comes online

**To get your public IP:**

```bash
# Wait a minute, then run this
aws ecs describe-tasks \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --tasks $(aws ecs list-tasks \
        --cluster mytower-cluster \
        --region us-east-2 \
        --query 'taskArns[0]' \
        --output text) \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --query 'tasks[0].attachments[0].details[?name==`networkInterfaceId`].value' \
    --output text | xargs -I {} aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces \
    --network-interface-ids {} \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --query 'NetworkInterfaces[0].Association.PublicIp' \
    --output text
```

Or **use the console** (easier!):
1. Go to: ECS → Clusters → mytower-cluster → Tasks
2. Click on your running task
3. Look for "Public IP" in the details

**Try it:** `http://<your-public-ip>:8000/graphql`

Let me know when you see the GraphQL playground! 🎉
Ah! The `ecsTaskExecutionRole` doesn't have permission to create CloudWatch log groups. Let's fix that:

## Add CloudWatch Logs Permission

```bash
# Create a policy that allows creating log groups
cat > logs-policy.json <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:*:log-group:/ecs/*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Attach this policy to the role
aws iam put-role-policy \
    --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \
    --policy-name CloudWatchLogsPolicy \
    --policy-document file://logs-policy.json
```

## Alternative: Create the Log Group Manually

Or, simpler - just create the log group ahead of time:

```bash
aws logs create-log-group \
    --log-group-name /ecs/mytower-server \
    --region us-east-2
```

## Then Retry

After either fix, try running the task again:

```bash
aws ecs run-task \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --task-definition mytower-task \
    --launch-type FARGATE \
    --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[${SUBNET_ID}],securityGroups=[${SG_ID}],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}" \
    --region us-east-2
```

**The second approach (manual log group creation) is faster** since IAM changes can take a minute to propagate.

Let me know which you prefer or if you hit another error!

Great question! Let me explain the trade-offs:

## Option 1: Add Permission to Role
```bash
aws iam put-role-policy \
    --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole \
    --policy-name CloudWatchLogsPolicy \
    --policy-document file://logs-policy.json
```

**What it does:** Gives the role permission to create log groups automatically

**Pros:**
- ✅ More flexible - can create multiple log groups in the future
- ✅ "Infrastructure as code" - the role is self-sufficient
- ✅ Better for production - containers can create their own logs

**Cons:**
- ❌ Takes 30-60 seconds for IAM changes to propagate
- ❌ Slightly broader permissions (minor security consideration)

---

## Option 2: Create Log Group Manually
```bash
aws logs create-log-group \
    --log-group-name /ecs/mytower-server \
    --region us-east-2
```

**What it does:** Pre-creates the log group so the role doesn't need permission to create it

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works immediately (no IAM propagation delay)
- ✅ Simpler - one command and done
- ✅ Slightly more secure (role has fewer permissions)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual step - not automated
- ❌ Have to remember to do this for each new task definition

---

## For Your Situation

Since you're just trying to **get it running now**, **Option 2 is perfect**.

**Later**, if you were automating this (like with Terraform or CloudFormation), you'd want Option 1 so everything is self-contained.

---

## Real-World Best Practice

Most production setups do **both**:
1. Pre-create log groups with proper retention settings (30 days, 90 days, etc.)
2. Give the role permission as a fallback

But for now, just creating the log group manually is totally fine! Did you run that command? Let's see if the task starts now!

Ah! Your Mac is building an ARM64 (Apple Silicon) image, but AWS Fargate in us-east-2 needs AMD64!

## Quick Fix: Rebuild for AMD64

```bash
# Rebuild your image for AMD64 platform
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t mytower-server .

# Re-tag and push to ECR
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
REGION=us-east-2
ECR_URI="${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com"

docker tag mytower-server:latest ${ECR_URI}/mytower-server:latest
docker push ${ECR_URI}/mytower-server:latest
```

This will take another few minutes to upload (cross-compiling for a different architecture).

## What Happened

- Your M1/M2 Mac builds ARM64 images by default
- Fargate supports ARM64 in **some** regions, but us-east-2 currently only has AMD64
- The `--platform linux/amd64` flag tells Docker to build for Intel/AMD processors

---

## After the Push Completes

The task definition already points to the right image URI, so you just need to run the task again:

```bash
aws ecs run-task \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --task-definition mytower-task \
    --launch-type FARGATE \
    --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[${SUBNET_ID}],securityGroups=[${SG_ID}],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}" \
    --region us-east-2
```

**Fun fact:** This is why your Dockerfile has multi-stage builds - it makes cross-platform compilation much faster!

Let me know when the push finishes!

**Congrats! Your game is running on AWS!** 🎉

## About the Fast Time

Yeah, the game is running at **real-time speed** with no rendering overhead. In desktop mode, pygame's frame limiting (60 FPS) naturally slows things down, but headless mode just runs as fast as the CPU allows.

You have a few options:
1. **Ignore it for now** - it's not causing problems, just burning through game time
2. **Add a sleep in the update loop** - we can throttle it later
3. **Pause it via GraphQL** - you could add a mutation to set game speed

For your portfolio demo, the fast speed might actually be cool - "look how many people it simulates!"

---

## Cleaning Up Failed Tasks

**Good news: You don't have to!** ECS automatically cleans up stopped tasks after a while (usually within an hour).

But if you want to see a cleaner console:

### Option 1: Console (Easiest)
1. Go to ECS → Clusters → mytower-cluster → Tasks
2. Check the boxes next to STOPPED tasks
3. Click "Delete" (top right)

### Option 2: CLI
```bash
# List all tasks (stopped and running)
aws ecs list-tasks \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --desired-status STOPPED \
    --region us-east-2

# ECS doesn't let you delete tasks via CLI - they auto-cleanup
# But you can stop running tasks if needed
```

**Note:** You can't actually "delete" tasks via CLI - AWS handles cleanup automatically. The console "delete" button just removes them from view.

---

## Important: Your Task is Running = Costs Money

Since you're on free tier with 50 GB-hours/month of Fargate:
- Your 0.5 GB task uses ~0.5 GB-hours per hour
- You can run ~100 hours/month free
- After that, it's ~$0.04/hour

**To stop the running task when you're done testing:**

### Console (easiest):
1. ECS → Clusters → mytower-cluster → Tasks
2. Select the RUNNING task
3. Click "Stop" button

### CLI:
```bash
# Get the task ARN
TASK_ARN=$(aws ecs list-tasks \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --desired-status RUNNING \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --query 'taskArns[0]' \
    --output text)

# Stop it
aws ecs stop-task \
    --cluster mytower-cluster \
    --task ${TASK_ARN} \
    --region us-east-2
```

---

## What's Your Public IP?

Try running some GraphQL queries! Here are some good ones to test:

```graphql
# Check building state
query {
  building {
    time
    money
    floorCount
    elevatorCount
    personCount
  }
}

# Add a floor
mutation {
  addFloor(floorType: OFFICE) {
    success
    floorNumber
  }
}

# Add a person
mutation {
  addPerson(floor: 1, block: 5.0, destFloor: 10, destBlock: 5.0) {
    success
    personId
  }
}
```

**Does it work?** 🚀
