# MyTower Web Frontend Configuration
# Copy this file to `.env` and customize for your local development environment

# ============================================================================
# Server Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Server host to connect to for GraphQL API and WebSocket subscriptions
#
# If not set, the frontend will connect to the same host that served it
# (window.location.hostname). This is the recommended setup for production.
#
# Common development scenarios:
# - Local development (backend running on same machine): localhost
# - Docker development (backend in container): host.docker.internal (Mac/Windows) or 172.17.0.1 (Linux)
# - Network testing (backend on another machine): 192.168.1.100 (actual IP)
#
# Default: window.location.hostname (same host as frontend)
# VITE_SERVER_HOST=localhost

# Server port for the backend API
# Default: 8000
# VITE_SERVER_PORT=8000

# ============================================================================
# Backend Configuration (for backend/headless mode)
# ============================================================================

# Command queue size for the game bridge (thread-safe command processing)
# Controls how many commands can be queued before blocking/rejecting new commands
#
# Considerations:
# - Higher values: Better burst handling, more memory usage
# - Lower values: Less memory, potential blocking under high load
# - Monitor logs for "Command queue is full" warnings
#
# Default: 100
# MYTOWER_COMMAND_QUEUE_SIZE=100

# ============================================================================
# Usage Examples
# ============================================================================
#
# Production (deployed to AWS/cloud):
#   - Don't set VITE_SERVER_HOST (or leave .env empty)
#   - Frontend will connect to same domain it's served from
#
# Local development (backend and frontend on same machine):
#   VITE_SERVER_HOST=localhost
#   VITE_SERVER_PORT=8000
#
# Local frontend + backend on different machine:
#   VITE_SERVER_HOST=192.168.50.59
#   VITE_SERVER_PORT=8000
#
# Docker Compose setup:
#   VITE_SERVER_HOST=backend  # Use service name from docker-compose.yml
#   VITE_SERVER_PORT=8000
#
# ============================================================================
# Important Notes
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the client bundle
# 2. Changes to .env require restarting the dev server (npm run dev)
# 3. .env files are gitignored - each developer needs their own copy
# 4. Never commit real credentials or sensitive data to .env.example
# 5. Protocol (http/https, ws/wss) is determined by the page's protocol
#    Production HTTPS sites will use wss:// and https:// automatically.
